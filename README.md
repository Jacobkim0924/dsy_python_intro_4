# Lists

### A list is a sequence
 A list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in list are called elements or sometimes items.

### Lists are mutable
The flow of while statement

    >>> numbers = [17, 123]
    >>> numbers[1] = 5
    >>> print(numbers)
* Any integer expression can be used as an index.
* If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError.
* If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.
